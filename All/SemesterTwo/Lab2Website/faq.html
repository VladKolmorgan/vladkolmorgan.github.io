                            Great question with an unfortunate answer. Frankly speaking we have no goods at the moment.
                            This website is only the start of the basis of our groundwork and we will need a lot more
                            time before we are able to sell all of our goods!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                <h3><a href="#">If you aren't fully operational does that mean neither is your website?</a></h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            A tricky question! The answer is both yes and no. We are not at full production meaning we 
                            can't do all the things we want to just yet. However, that doesn't mean we can't do some of
                            them. For instance the contact page works perfectly and we will get back to you at our 
                            earliest convenience!

                <h3><a href="#">What do I need to take care of my ants?</a></h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Ant care is important when you want to have your own colony! First you'll need a place to put 
                            them such as an ant farm along with some soil. Then you'll need ants, a queen to reproduce for
                            the hive and some worker ants to do work such as tunnel building and obtaining food. Then you'll
                            need to consider diet generally speaking things they would get in there own environment would be 
                            best. Ensure the proper amount of moisture and heat, and you're ant farm is ready to go! For a more

                <h3><a href="#">Other facts about ants?</a></h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            There are a lot of places to get some great ant facts! There are many online forums, games, 
                            educational books, and countless documents dedicated towards the sharing of Information
                            about ants. We'll share some quick ones however such as there being over 12,000 different species
                            of ants, ants can carry well over 10 times there own weight, and ant queens can live for 
                            several years before dying! You can find more information here at this

                <h3><a href="#">Is there really 20 quadrillion ants?</a></h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            No there really isn't. There is likely much more of them at this point, as the last time someone
                            tried to accurately predict how many ants there were was in 2020. To make it even more complicated
                            it was only an educated guess not an actual amount, so the number can be much higher or lower!
