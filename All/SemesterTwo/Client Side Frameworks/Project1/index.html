                <h2>HELLDIVERS The Game</h2>
                <div>
                    HELLDIVERS 2 is a 3rd person shooter in which you and up to 3 other players are launched at extremely 
                    fast speeds into the surface of an alien infested planet with one simple goal: liberate and spread 
                    managed democracy. You are always outnumbered, but that doesn’t mean you are outgunned. Well, usually 
                    you will be, but HELLDIVERS has a unique system to equal the playing field called stratagems. These 
                    are various equipment and ordinance which you will use to make a swarm of enemies into a smoldering 
                    pile of liberty! The goal is to liberate all occupied planets or planets being sieged to ensure 
                    democracy is spread across the whole galaxy.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The game map for players is a map that displays the galaxy that they reside in. At the center is the 
                    capital Super Earth, and all around are Super Earth controlled planets, past that is enemy occupied 
                    planets. These planets are the goal, to liberate every single planet from their alien counterparts 
                    so Super Earth can exploit the planets for resources. Every mission completed adds onto a liberation 
                    counter for a planet, once it reaches 100% the planet is completely liberated. Liberation of planets 
                    takes tens of thousands of players, sometimes even hundreds of thousands of people trying to contain 
                    alien threats.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="earth" class="container-fluid parallax bg_earth"></div>
            <div class="container-fluid bg-warning">
                <h2>Helldivers And Super Earth</h2>
                <div>
                    Super Earth is a significantly more advanced version of Earth, which is ruled by a certain set of 
                    ideals. Prosperity, liberty, and democracy are the only way of life the citizens of Super Earth know. 
                    Any other form of government, or even insults to the holding government, are looked on as grievous 
                    crimes and are usually punished by freedom camps or even capital punishment.
                </div>
                <div>
                    However, within Super Earth’s government and military is a branch of the military called the 
                    Helldivers. Helldivers are regarded as an elite peacekeeping force for Super Earth. Their purpose 
                    is to deal with any threat to Super Earth’s government policies. This can vary from traitors to 
                    aliens, the main enemy of the game. Helldivers are dropped into the worst possible situation deep 
                    into enemy territory to complete a set of objectives. Once all objectives are complete the Helldiver 
                    squad of 4 members are advised to extract, however that may not always be possible. In these cases 
                    their brave sacrifices will never be forgotten nor will they have been in vain.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="gear" class="container-fluid parallax bg_gear"></div>
            <div class="container-fluid bg-primary">
                <h2>Weapons Gear</h2>
                <div>
                    Helldivers, the players, will be almost always outnumbered, and with enemy units who are tanks who 
                    can block bullets there needs to be ways to deal with these threats. Each helldiver gets a primary 
                    which can be a one of many things (machine guns, snipers, shotguns, etc) they also get a sidearm 
                    (pistol, submachine gun, lasers) and a grenade of their choice (stuns, explosives, fire). However, 
                    as strong as the weapons can be it isn’t enough for the extra strong enemies, or more often, the 
                    swarms of enemies that attack you. That is where stratagems come in. Players can select 4 different 
                    stratagems before a mission, each player by default gets a team ammo drop, a reinforce for 
                    respawning dead teammates, and an SOS beacon to ask for help from other players looking for a match. 
                    Stratagems vary from equipment, to vehicles, to orbital ordinance, to close air support, to even 
                    defenses such as turrets.
                </div>
                <div>
                    A single helldiver that utilizes their stratagems well can remove hundreds of enemies including. 
                    Ultimately though, even if they are armed to the teeth they are still one person, and a person with 
                    only so much skill and ammo. That is why players must play with their team to win, and if they lose 
                    their team they need to revive them. This helps to promote team play and interaction between players.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Stratagems use certain button combinations in order to use. For example, in a mission while on a 
                    controller if you hold the L1 on a Playstation controller, it will open a panel that shows all the 
                    stratagems you can call in and their cooldowns. Then, hypothetically, a player wants to revive their 
                    teammate, they would press their Dpad on the left of their controller up, down, left, right, up. 
                    Then, all they need to do is throw it, or drop it if they get knocked down, to use the stratagem. 
                    However, there are dozens of stratagems to accommodate several different play styles.

            <div id="auto" class="container-fluid parallax bg_auto"></div>
            <div class="container-fluid bg-danger">
                <h2>The Automatons</h2>
                <div>
                    The automatons are an alien species which are simply robots. They come in a variety of enemies from 
                    foot soldiers with chainsaws for arms, to foot soldiers with rocket launchers, to massive hulking 
                    masses of metal which are as thick as a tank, oh and they have tanks too. The Automatons are 
                    considered hard, but there is a lot of debate if they are harder than the second enemy faction or 
                    not. Their goal is simply the destruction of Super Earth, as Automatons are an offshoot of the 
                    Cyborgs, a faction from the first HELLDIVERS, with a minor change being that they simply don’t have 
                    flesh.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Automatons are focused on firepower and will release countless rounds at the Helldivers in order to 
                    remove them from their territory and repel the invaders. They also have rockets, tank shells, 
                    artillery, landmines, and even lasers at their disposal. These make the Automatons a truly powerful 
                    foe that cannot be underestimated.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="term" class="container-fluid parallax bg_term"></div>
            <div class="container-fluid bg-warning">
                <h2>The Terminids</h2>
                <div>
                    The second, and likely most popular faction in Helldivers, are the Terminids. These large bugs are 
                    reminiscent of the bugs from the movie STARSHIP TROOPERS, in fact the whole game is vaguely similar 
                    to that movie. However, these bugs are very important to Super Earth, as they can be turned into a 
                    very rich fuel for their spaceships. It is actually due to this that the Terminids were used in 
                    farms. Sadly, they broke free and are now rampaging the galaxy as a bug swarm that destroys any human 
                    they see. 
                </div>
                <div>
                    Funnily enough, the Terminids are considered undemocratic and deserving of liberty by Helldivers 
                    according to Super Earth. As you can imagine the Terminids mostly consist of bugs, mainly bugs 
                    that resemble that of ants, roly poly, fleas/mites, or even a mantis. The most lethal without a 
                    doubt is a bug called a hunter or the larger version the stalker (who can go invisible), who 
                    functions as a large mantis that can cut down a Helldiver in only a couple slashes, despite bullet 
                    proof armor. There are also bile spewers that spit out acid onto their enemies, flying bugs, and 
                    even a giant bug that towers over the battlefield that can easily crush friend and foe alike.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="illu" class="container-fluid parallax bg_illu"></div>
            <div class="container-fluid bg-primary">
                <h2>Other Factions</h2>
                <div>
                    Currently there are only two factions, the Automatons and the Terminids, however in the first 
                    HELLDIVERS there was a third. A squid like creature the Illuminate were an advanced civilization, 
                    however their government was seen as undemocratic and was deemed worthy of liberation, as well as 
                    their advanced technologies of course. It is highly likely if not guaranteed that they will make 
                    their appearance at some point in the game's lifetime. The devs are likely waiting for a good time 
                    to release them upon Super Earth to have Helldivers fight this threat.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The Illuminate are a very weak faction and due to this need to use shields and cloaking to protect 
                    or hide themselves. In the first HELLDIVERS they use lasers and electricity to subdue and eliminate 
                    their enemies. They were also notorious for their ability to stun targets, disorientate, and even 
                    teleport themselves. If, if not when, the Illuminate are added to the game players will likely find 
                    themselves struggling against such opponents.
                </div>
                <div>
                    It is possible an unknown fourth faction will appear, but at this time events in the game occur in 
                    which unknown blue lasers hit players on mission. It is safe to say the next enemy that will be 
                    introduced to the galactic war is the Illuminate.
