            <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>My goal is to get my AAS for coding which I should finish at the end of the Spring semester of 2025. This will be a great step for me to branch out and make connections to companies and other businesses that want my skills, as well as to practice and further improve my coding abilities.</p>
                <p>I also plan to become a game developer, I want to do solo projects and work up to group development and someday work for or own a gaming company to develope my fun and enjoyable games.</p>
